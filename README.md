# Stock-Price-Prediction

The Project is based on Time Series Analysis.
It works with the stock data of last 20 years(i.e. 2000-2020) of HDFC Bank pvt. ltd.
The main reason to do this project is to analyse the expected trend versus the observed trend during the years.
It also shows the main purpose of making the data stationary with dickey-fuller test before performing the analysis.
It also shows the use of Auto Regressive and Moving Average approach to perform the Analysis.

# Challenges

Previously , I use to perform Time Series Analysis on data using pen and paper with different forms of calculation.
In the beginning it was little confusing when I decided to implement it using Python but then I realised that rather doing a huge calculation the amazing libraries of python 
makes my work complete with some few lines of code.
Finding the value of p,q,d.
An amazing experience to work on this project.

Stay Tuned for some more projects in this Domain.

Thank You....
